        "question": "What steps should the provincial government take to improve healthcare accessibility and quality in British Columbia?",
        "answers": [
          { "text": "The provincial government must strengthen public healthcare by adding 45,000 healthcare workers and connecting every resident to a family doctor or nurse practitioner. We should streamline licensing for foreign-trained professionals within six weeks and offer loan forgiveness incentives for graduates committing to five years of service in BC. Additionally, building new hospitals, reducing wait times for cancer care, and enhancing mental health resources for youth will ensure our healthcare system meets growing demand while safeguarding it from privatization.", "points": "NDP" },
          { "text": "To improve healthcare accessibility and quality in British Columbia, the provincial government must adopt a new 'Patients First' model. This involves creating a single-payer healthcare system that funds hospitals based on the number of patients they treat, encouraging efficiency and faster care. They should guarantee timely access to diagnostics and surgeries by allowing patients to seek care at pre-approved out-of-province facilities if wait times exceed recommended limits. Expanding partnerships with non-government clinics will help reduce wait times for priority procedures. Finally, simplifying paperwork for family doctors will enable them to see more patients, ensuring everyone can access the care they need promptly.", "points": "Cons" },
          { "text": "The provincial government must enhance public healthcare by establishing integrated community health centers in every riding, ensuring all residents have access to a family doctor or nurse practitioner. We should streamline administrative processes, remove unnecessary requirements like doctorsâ€™ notes for short-term illnesses, and expedite licensing for foreign-trained professionals. Additionally, increasing funding for public healthcare workers, implementing loan forgiveness incentives for healthcare graduates, and conducting health impact assessments for industrial activities will strengthen our system while safeguarding it from privatization.", "points": "Green" }
